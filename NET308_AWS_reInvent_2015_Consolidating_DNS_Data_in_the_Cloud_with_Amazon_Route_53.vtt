00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
hope you everyone had a great conference
I hope there ended on a good note for
you so we're going to talk about

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
consolidating DNS data in the cloud with
amazon route 53 I'm Li Zhen I'm a dev
manager for the service part of edge

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
services great so let's jump right in
we're going to talk about why you should
do this initially and why it's the right

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
time so really comes down to a lot of
the same things about moving into the
cloud cost cost is a big reason to

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
consolidate your DNS in the cloud
running your own DNS servers could be
expensive you have to operate them and

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
you have to run lots of them when you
use route 53 we operate dozens of edge
locations around the world and we charge

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by the query and so you only pay for
what you use it not going to have to pay
a whole lot we're talk about forty cents

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
for every million queries simplicity you
can manage all your stuff in route 53
consolidating everything makes life a

9
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
whole lot easier you have a single view
of all of your DNS you can have all your
hosted zones in route 53 you can manage

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
all your DNS data in one place and you
can manage it all via our easy-to-use
API hopefully most of the people in this

11
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
room or in the most of this so I'm going
to keep going pretty quickly today we'll
be covering basic DNS use cases so

12
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
really how to migrate the more simple
stuff and how to consolidate all of that
within route 53 and the ration talk a

13
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
little bit a lot about advanced use
cases with private DNS and some of the
cool things you can do in combining your

14
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
existing architectures with private DNS
so the diagram we're really going to be
looking at is something like this where

15
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you may have example.com whatever domain
you or set of domains you currently own
you may run a public dns server and that

16
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
public dns server may be serving your
dns on behalf of your domains out to the
general internet you might have some

17
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
third-party monitoring you might have
some things looking at whether your
servers are healthy or not checking to

18
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
see if Layton sees are good whether or
not things are actually running in your
own data centers you might have your own

19
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
just monitoring as well Plus maybe even
some more internal dns servers to serve
dns within your corporate network for

20
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
example we're going to talk about moving
all of that into the cloud and so we'll
be doing that with route 53 public zones

21
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
route 53 health checks and route 50 free
private zones so where do we start well
we can start by bulk transferring all

22
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the domains that you currently manage
into route 53 and that might seem like a
pretty daunting task so we're going to

23
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
do it step-by-step the first step is to
export DNS into route 53 what this means
is taking the DNS that you currently

24
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
manage and having the way that those
records are served and actually having
route 53 serve them on your behalf the

25
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
next step is to actually delegate
authority to route 53 and what that
means is by delegating authority when

26
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
other resolvers on the internet are
attempting to do dns resolution they
will contact route 53 instead of the

27
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
existing DNS servers that you use and
the last step is the transfer domains to
wrap up mp3 so in case you didn't know

28
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
route 53 actually offers domain name
registration you can go and buy or
transfer domains into route 53 so you

29
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
can go to route 53 and you can search
for you know my new domain com and buy
it or you can transfer an existing

30
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
domain into route 53 and here we're
going to talk about both transferring
all your domains into R alpha p3 and

31
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
actually you'll notice that the order
here really matters it really matters
for availability so you could do it the

32
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
other way you could first transfer the
domains and then export and delegate the
authority to route 53 we don't recommend

33
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
doing that the reason for doing this in
this order is this guarantees that you
first have route 53 serving your records

34
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
before you actually transfer in some
cases if you transfer first the
transferring registrar may decide to if

35
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000
you for example have your DNS coupled
with your registration you may actually
lose dns resolution as part of the

36
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
transfer process if you transfer first
depending on the registrar you're using
so some registrar's actually when you

37
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
hansford domain out decide to stop
serving the DNS records on your behalf
once you do that so we highly recommend

38
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
going in this order by making sure your
DNS records are being served by ralphs
it would be first before you transfer

39
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the domains over so how do we export the
DNS this is highly dependent on your
existing DNS provider will talk through

40
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000
two examples first one is if you use
someone like go den for your DMS godaddy
if you go to the website and you log

41
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
into your management console there's
actually a DNS zone file tab and there's
an export option you will select that

42
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and then actually download the zone file
and then you would download a zone file
for each of the zones or each of the

43
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
domains that you want to transfer or if
you're running your own bind server for
example typically you would find this in

44
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
wherever you have your name D
configuration so if you're using like a
shuru jail or something like that you

45
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
might find it in VAR name d and you
would have your zone files hosted in
there you then use CLI 53 it's an open

46
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000
source command lines skip tool to import
the zone into route 53 so here's a
pretty uneasy example you can see we

47
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
really just iterate through each zone
file and you can really just with two
commands create the zone and then import

48
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that zone file into relative to three
and so what this will do is it will
create a hosted zone in route 53 and

49
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
then shove all the records from that
zone file into that hosted zone and then
now that zone is ready to serve the

50
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
records on your behalf at that point
you'll want to delegate the authority to
route 53 so this is the step I mentioned

51
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
we're now name servers or resolvers
rather on the internet will be able to
contact route 53 in order to do domain

52
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
name resolution for you so this step is
registrar dependent here's an example if
you use namecheap for example as your

53
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
registrar they have an API you would be
able to go to the API provide your API
details and then you would issue this

54
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
command to set the dns servers to the
delegation set so you can see here we
have four name servers listed NS 425 NS

55
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
790
3 etc those nameservers come with each
hosted zones so when you create a hosted

56
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
zone in route 53 you get a unique set of
name servers and so you would do this
for each of the domains you were

57
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
transferring again you can imagine how
you could easily script something like
this you will want to check that you're

58
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000
actually delegated so simple example
would be to do a dig trace so we have an
example up here showing how you can this

59
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
is a concatenated output so you can see
remove some of the less interesting
details but first we have the roots name

60
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
servers followed by the dot-com name
servers then finally followed by the
name servers for AWS architecture blog

61
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000
com and you can see that for those
nameservers those are actually delegated
to ralphs 53s name servers after you've

62
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
done that you'll want to wait for the
TTLs the time to live on those records
to expire so here you can see that the

63
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:44.000
time to live is 170 2,800 seconds which
is two days and so will want to wait for
those two days before we continue doing

64
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
anything else so after those two days
all the resolvers around the world
should hopefully have by that point

65
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
expire their caches and now see that
route 53 is authoritative for this
domain and at that point we can transfer

66
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
the domains again depending on who your
domain name registrar is this is going
to be depended on the Registrar you'll

67
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
want to unlock the domain so that it can
be transferred here's another namecheap
API example and then you'll want to

68
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
obtain the authorization codes for those
domains so for example GoDaddy actually
has a bulk download option you would go

69
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000
into the console you can get all your
domain codes of the authorization codes
in bulk and then again we can script

70
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
this I have a ruby example up here using
the AWS sdk you would use the WC SDK
with the route 53 domains client and

71
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
here you can see we go through each of
the off codes for each of the domains
you can imagine having this auth code

72
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
CSV which might have your domain names
and and the actual authorization codes
and then here I've actually not shown

73
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the full arguments as what you will need
to do is you will actually include
name plus the authorization code plus

74
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:06.000
all of your contact information /
typical domain transfer configuration so
that that takes care of the public zones

75
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that's pretty simple so now you can
imagine if we've done something along
the lines of what I've dis outlined will

76
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
have transferred all the authority that
route 53 route 53 will be serving all of
our public dns records for example calm

77
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and will have transferred all the domain
name registration into route 53 days of
service what about the the monitoring

78
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
part though so let's let's talk briefly
about that so you can take advantage of
AWS integration once you've actually

79
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
done this transfer one of the cool
things you can take advantage of is
alias alias is a specific record type

80
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
within route 53 that allows you to point
your domain name apex at an elastic load
balancer or cloud front distribution or

81
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
s3 website and so in a very simple way
you can actually point the apex which
you normally would have the cname which

82
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
you can't do but using taking advantage
of alias you can actually you can
actually do that and point that at those

83
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
resources you can also take advantage of
route 53 s health checks in DNS failover
recently in case you didn't know last

84
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
month we launched calculated health
checks calculated health checks allow
you to combine multiple health checks

85
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000
into a single health check using and or
or rules and you can actually also
manually failover health checks using

86
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
calculated health checks as well so it's
a very powerful tool both for DNS
failover so in my previous top last year

87
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I talked a lot about how you can take
advantage of route 53 DNS failover to do
all sorts of conditional flows and

88
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
things like that basically treating
alias trees as a way of having a
decision tree essentially or logic tree

89
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
within route 53 recordsets I encourage
you to check out that talk from last
year if you if you didn't catch it so

90
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
weak you can use DNS failover to really
have really powerful ways to decide how
to dynamically return different answers

91
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
based on the condition of your system
and calculated health checks adds a
whole new dimension to be able to do

92
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
that in addition it really helps provide
replacement for any kind of monitoring
solutions you might have in place today

93
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
so in addition to in addition to
calculated health checks we also
announced latency measurements as part

94
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
of health checks last month as well and
so when you create a health check you
can also get back latency measurements

95
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
against wherever and when you're
checking and so those two things
combined can really help you with with

96
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000
all the monitoring for for an end point
so now we've gotten the third-party
external monitoring moved over I should

97
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
have mentioned also that rapid three
actually checks your endpoint from
multiple locations around the globe and

98
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
we've also been able to move the
internal system monitoring over since we
actually are able to monitor your

99
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
instances within the easy to as well so
now let's talk about this last piece
moving internal dns over that's actually

100
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000
pretty simple too we can set a private
dns so what private dns is is it's a way
to create a private zone within your

101
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
virtual private cloud so within your VPC
you can actually have a hosted zone that
is only visible within that VPC this was

102
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
a future we announced last November and
so you can see here I have a simple
console example that shows creating a

103
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:34.000
domain name example.com tech and
associating it with a specific VPC ID so
from within that VPC example that integ

104
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000
is now resolvable but only from within
that VPC you can actually associate
multiple V pcs to a zone and multiple

105
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.000
zones to a VPC and again if we want it
to script this and make this really easy
we can simply use Clive 53 to import all

106
00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000
our zone data from our existing internal
dns systems into route 53 private dns
alright so we're done right we moved

107
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000
everything into route 53 and into the
cloud we have our public zone being
managed in route 53 we've managed to

108
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
move all of our monitoring solutions
into the cloud and we also have even our
private DNS data in the cloud as well

109
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but not quite
it's very possible in fact lots of
customers we talked to have laptops or

110
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
clients sitting in their corporate
networks or they still have various
reasons to keep an on-premise data

111
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000
center around so what do we do about
that so let's talk about how you can
actually take advantage of private DNS

112
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in conjunction with an existing data
center so in order to do that we have to
talk a little bit about what it means to

113
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
use the with it the resolver within the
VPC so within the VPC typically the
resolver is going to sit at what we call

114
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000
the gateway plus to address so for
example if your VPC sub that is a 10 /
16 then the 1000 to address is going to

115
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:15.000
be where all your DNS resolution happens
by default the way private DNS works is
you query that 1000 to address again in

116
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
the 10 / 16 example and private DNS
combines both the resolver and the
authority into one so this is kind of a

117
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
limitation where it means you can't use
the 1000 to address as an authoritative
server so some customers have wanted to

118
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
for example delegate to 1000 to that
doesn't quite work because it actually
acts as a resolver not as an

119
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000
authoritative name server similarly the
1000 to address is actually not
addressable from outside of the VPC it's

120
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000
kind of a magic address and so we'll
talk about various ways in which you can
work around that and finally delegation

121
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
back to other name servers via NS
records within private DNS doesn't work
either again because of the fact that

122
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
we've combined the resolver and
authority in the way private DNS works
so these are some limitations of the way

123
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
private DNS works within VPC today we're
definitely aware of these limitations
and are working toward making them

124
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
better but if you're not there are
actually really cool things you can do
to make everything work so we talked

125
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:29.000
about that so here of a diagram showing
kind of an on-premise network again
could be an existing data center or your

126
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
corporate network we have a query
we have a resolver that the query is
going to go to and then we would like

127
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
that query to be able to go through to
route 53 private DNS in order to get
some kind of answer so for example you

128
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000
might imagine you might be running
something in VPC that you want to be
able to address and you want to be able

129
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
to actually get the answer for that it
could be some kind of internal
application server or whatever it is but

130
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
you need to be able to get to that
address so what you want to happen have
happened is you want this query for that

131
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000
name to go to the resolver and from that
resolver to go to the plus two resolver
sitting in the VPC and for that to

132
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:19.000
actually ask route 53 is Authority okay
well what's the answer to this name and
for that query answer to travel all the

133
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000
way back to the original client who want
to know but as I mentioned that doesn't
work because the path from the resolver

134
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to the plus two isn't going to exactly
fly how do we fix this let's take a
forwarder in between and this actually

135
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
makes everything work so we can actually
have the query go to the resolver which
goes to the floor der sitting in your

136
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
VPC this DNS border will then for the
query on to the plus to address which is
now visible since the border is sitting

137
00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:05.000
within the VPC and then the query will
then go on to query the private zone and
then the answer will flow back

138
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
we'll talk about how to set up this
border now so a super easy way to get
this forward or set up is to just run

139
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
unbound as the border so you could
imagine spinning up an easy to instance
installing unbound and then configuring

140
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
unbalanced so here we have a sample
unbound configuration this sample
configuration essentially tells unbound

141
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to listen on everything and answer all
queries in the local subnet we reload
the on back configuration and voila you

142
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
have a forwarder in your VPC that is
able to allow your your on-premises
network to to be able to create route 53

143
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.000
VP private DNS answers oh yeah one last
configuration you have to actually add
the forward zone so the here we actually

144
00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:01.000
have named as the route and this Ford's
the the this is setting it up to forward
all the queries to the the plus to

145
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
address that i mentioned earlier you
could also imagine changing the name
here from the root to some other domain

146
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
so for example if you only want to Ford
certain certain queries to to the to the
plus to address you could do that as

147
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.000
well another option is actually to set
up AWS directory service as the
forwarder and this is actually the

148
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
recommended method because it's a fully
managed on your behalf and be if you
want to utilize active directory within

149
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
your virtual private cloud you actually
get to take advantage of that as well
and this is actually really easy to do

150
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:45.000
so if you've never played with ablest
directory service you can go into the
console and if you pop open the AWS

151
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
directory service part of the console
there's a button that says create simple
ad and so we will create a simple active

152
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
directory within our VPC typically the
way this gets configured is you will be
asked to have two subnets within your BP

153
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
see those subnets are where the active
directory controllers will be placed and
so here you can see we have to DNS

154
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:18.000
addresses for our directory in this
example the 1001 114 and 1002 135
and if we hop on to a host within that

155
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:26.000
BBC you'd see something like this for
the resolve calm so for people who
aren't as familiar resolv.conf specifies

156
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
how a host is going to do its dns
resolution and so here you can actually
see that the nameservers is pointing to

157
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:42.000
are those two name servers that were
configured as part of creating our
symbol directory so just to show a quick

158
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:53.000
example if we this is this is this is a
example of a private hosted zone in
route 53 called cloud da Zhen and we

159
00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:02.000
have an example record here example that
clouds and it's a txt record says hello
world and so if we go to the instance

160
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000
running in that VPC and we were to dig
for example cloud odds n we would
actually get back that answer and you

161
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
can see if you look if you take note of
the server replying on on our behalf
it's actually the Active Directory

162
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
server so it's it's the it's the 0 1
1001 114 dress which is the active
directory name server that's actually

163
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:35.000
answering on behalf so the way we
recommend customers configure this is so
you have active directory running within

164
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
your VPC and we actually may actually
suggest managing all non active
directory names in private DNS so when

165
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
you were an active directory you
actually get a DNS server as part of
active directory as well and you could

166
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
manage a lot of DNS with an active
directory however we recommend managing
all the non hostnames everything that's

167
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
not part of your Active Directory
installation in private DNS for two
reasons one it's going to fall through

168
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000
so for example if if the name isn't in
Active Directory it's going to continue
to go to route 53 so the reason so what

169
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000
what you can then do is use the API
endpoint in route 53 as opposed to
having to figure out how to script

170
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
against active directory within your VPC
and having a less accessible endpoint
the other reason is zones can cross

171
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
regions with private DNS so as I
mentioned earlier you can actually have
a single zone associated with multiple

172
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
VP sees those v pcs don't even need to
be in the same where you
and so this allows you to have a single

173
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000
view across all your availability zones
all your regions all your BBC's and
manage your all in one place whereas if

174
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
you were to do this in Active Directory
that would it be a regional view
specific to that VPC where the Active

175
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Directory lives so going back to the
diagram we have something that looks
like this right we have a query going to

176
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
a resolver going to the forwarder to the
plus two and then the answer coming all
the way back through and so so far we've

177
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:12.000
configured this four-door orange box how
do we configure the box that's the
resolver to make sure that it talks to

178
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.000
the forwarder that is also very easy
I'll show two examples one for bind and
one for unbound so assuming you run

179
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.000
binder unbound in your corporate data
center or in your office or wherever it
is for bind you would simply have those

180
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000
too forward or set up and that's the
first example on the top of the slide so
there you would have all the queries

181
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
from your on-premise data center go
through and and hit those two name
servers that are in the VPC so this this

182
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
is assuming by the way that your vbc and
your on-premise or corporate data center
or whatever it is is VPN together and

183
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000
possibly direct connected the second
example on the bottom half the slide
shows an example where you have a single

184
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000
zone that you were going to afford so
here maybe you have you only want to
forward craze for that specific zone

185
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:17.000
into the DPC to get resolved
similarly you can do the same thing with
unbound the the top half of the slide is

186
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
also if you wanted to Ford everything
through and the bottom half of the slide
is if you only want the Ford that that

187
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:36.000
one single zone another thing I
mentioned earlier is that it's not
really possible to sub delegate a zone

188
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
or it's not possible to have NS records
within your private zone that end up
being respected and this is as I

189
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
mentioned due to the reason to the fact
that we have the resolver and the
authority combined so kind of that

190
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000
right-hand side of the diagram those
really are one unit in the way that it
looks within the bpc and so what we

191
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
recommend here is to flatten your zone
instead of sub delegating what this
means is if you have a sub domain say

192
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
sub Club does that in this example
instead of creating another private
hosted zone called sub clouds n simply

193
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
manage all the sub domains as part of
the existing zone instead of creating
additional zones so this this is this is

194
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:28.000
a simple technique to ensure that
everything gets result cleanly and
easily

195
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
another use case that customers often
run into is that the on-premise the
on-premises resolver or DNS

196
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:42.000
infrastructure contains data that's not
in private DNS there's actually multiple
ways to deal with this one way would be

197
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000
to loop the query through the
on-premises system another way we would
be to copy the data into private DNS in

198
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
a third way which we won't really cover
today is to set up conditional
forwarding in Active Directory this last

199
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
method is assuming you're running your
own Active Directory server and you have
the ability to actually set of

200
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:10.000
conditional forwarding so we'll talk
about the first two so this is going to
be a little convoluted looking but I'm

201
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
sorry this this first slide we're going
to talk about this is kind of what it
would look like from this is the

202
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000
existing view so this is if the query is
coming from on-premise this is this this
all works and here what what if the data

203
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
is actually in on the other side so you
have a query originating within the VPC
but the data is sitting and the

204
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
on-premise network how do we get how do
we get that data back and so we're gonna
do something a little bit round about

205
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
when we by looping the query through the
on-premise so we actually what we would
do is have the query go back into the

206
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:50.000
on-premise infrastructure instead of
asking the be local DNS and then having
that continue through to the forwarder

207
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000
to the plus 2 and to route 53 so here in
this case if the local resolver already
has the answer it's just going to answer

208
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:10.000
and return back to the query if not it's
going to continue forwarding through and
forward into the VPC and just as before

209
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:28.000
clicker is not working just as before
the query will come back through so in
the first thing in the first case that I

210
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
mentioned here if the query is
originating from within the VPC and the
data is in the on-premise network by

211
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
routing it kind of back through we would
be able to ensure that anything that's
already in the on-premise network will

212
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000
get answered and if it's not it's going
to continue all the way through the way
you would configure this is to as we

213
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
talked about in the result com have have
the hosts actually searched the name
server for the on-premise resolver first

214
00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:01.000
before it searches the forwarders within
within the VPC the other option would be
to copy the data into private DNS and so

215
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:11.000
pretty easy way to do this is to use a
tool called route 53 d or you could use
high 53 so we talked about Clyde 53 as

216
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
an import mechanism earlier route 53 d
if you go online it's an open source
tool that allows you to essentially

217
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:27.000
transfer zones into route 53 and I have
a sample configuration here out of route
53 d it's fairly simple you would you

218
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
would essentially specify the domain
name that you care about and the
corresponding zone ID and route 53 run

219
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.000
the route 53 demon on your on your DNS
servers and that will keep the data
synced between your DNS server and route

220
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:50.000
53 and so by doing this you'll actually
just simply have the data sitting in the
route 53 Authority and you can have the

221
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
query go directly to the plus 2 resolver
from from your client query the
authority and have the day to come right

222
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000
back and here we build it you would get
back the answer for whatever on-premise
data that you you actually care about

223
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:14.000
right actually zip through this pretty
quickly so in summary consolidating your
DNS infrastructure in the cloud is is

224
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
easy and it simplifies management all
that infrastructure we're able to manage
both your private data and public data

225
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
all in one place
there are a number of ways to combine
private DNS with an on-premise or

226
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
existing solution we talk through how
you might be able to copy data back and
forth or how you label the route queries

227
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
throughout the data center architectures
and where some of the limitations around
the plus to address and are actively

228
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:54.000
working toward making that situation a
whole lot better please complete your
evaluations if you have a chance thanks
for your time I hope everyone had a
great reinvent
